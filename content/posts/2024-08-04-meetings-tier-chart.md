my meeting tier chart by takeaways

<!--more-->

* if I learn something, A tier. S tier if I learn something I care about. also S
  tier if I don't have to actively engage but like I pick up content anyways
* if I get to shitpost irl, A or S tier. definitely S tier if other
  meeting-goers shitpost with me. note that you probably need to know the other
  attendees pretty well before you try this.
* if I teach someone else something and they learn, B tier. gotta increase the
  bus ratio.
* if I leave with a new task, C tier. B tier if it's something I'm interested
  in. Also B tier if the ticket is made in the meeting so I don't have to write
  up the ticket afterwards (but I will if I have to, I guess)
* reporting on something that I think you should already know about, due to
  either your position or the availability of the information (i.e., it's
  something written down somewhere accessible to you and does not just live
  inside my head) - F tier. absolutely awful. I do my research to make things
  happen, so can you. you need updates on a project I'm working on? check the
  jira ticket that tracks the work. jira ticket even has links to the PR so you
  could read the diffs to see exactly what I'm working on.
